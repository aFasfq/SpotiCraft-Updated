# This project will no longer be maintained

Due to Spotify’s recent investment and price changes, I decided to completely stop the development of this mod.

# NEW USER PLEASE READ
If you're planning to use the mod, and you didn't use it before, you may not be able to do so, if the Spotify app hits the 30 daily user limit, the mod may crash when trying to load data from your account, for news about this you can go [see this issue on GitHub](https://github.com/LeonimusTTV/SpotiCraft/issues/2) \
\
A workaround for this is to make your own Spotify app and build the mod yourself, you'll need to update it every new release and build it again, see the [How to build the mod](#how-to-build-the-mod)
# SpotiCraft - A new way of listening to music

These are the **official** links to download the mod on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spoticraft-2) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/spoticraft-2) \
Another mod also called SpotiCraft exist, it's not maintained anymore, but you can always go check it -> https://github.com/IMB11/Spoticraft/tree/master (fabric only)

## FAQ

### Minecraft keep crashing after updating the mod

If that happen to you, before making an issue, try to delete the "spoticraft" folder in the Minecraft folder (where the mods folder is)\
If Minecraft keep crashing, try to only have this mod in your mods' folder\
If Minecraft still crash, make an issue and don't forget your log file

## Version List
For now, I'll support Forge + NeoForge from 1.21.4 (and upcoming versions if not a lot of the code need to be changed) to 1.19.
I'm also testng Fabric support, please create an issue.

## API
### The API will no longer be used after 0.0.5-beta due to Spotify new security policies
[SpotifyAuthHandler.java](https://github.com/LeonimusTTV/SpotiCraft/blob/master/src/main/java/com/leonimust/spoticraft/server/SpotifyAuthHandler.java#L31) use an API to get the access_token and refresh it, if you want to use yours you can get the [repo here](https://github.com/LeonimusTTV/SpotiCraft-API) if you want an example.

## How to build the mod
This guide uses [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [IntelliJ from JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and the [JAVA JDK from Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/)

### Installation Part

2. Install [JAVA 21](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/) JDK or [JAVA 17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17) JDK for minecraft 1.20.x (don't forget to check the "Set or override JAVA_HOME variable")\

### Build Time
1. Now time to build\
   **Forge**: for Forge, open the gradle menu at the right of your screen, go into jarJar and double click on "jarJar"\
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8948dc9-8790-4ff0-a705-95d7621a601b)

**NeoForge**: for NeoForge you'll need to enter a command to build the mod (if you're using a version that only has NeoForge like 1.21.2, do the same as Forge)

**Windows**:
```bash
.\gradlew --build-file=build-neoforge.gradle jarJar
```

**Linux/MacOs**:
```bash
./gradlew --build-file=build-neoforge.gradle jarJar
```

**Fabric**: for Fabric, open the gradle menu at the right of your screen, go into build and double click on "build"\
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e61e2bb-a5af-4a01-a90f-1473415f8ddd)

2. Now open the "build" folder then "libs"

**Forge**: the only file you see (the one that ends with -all.jar) is the mod, put it into your mods folder

**NeoForge**: you'll have two files, one with "-all.jar" at the end and one without, use the one that has "-all.jar", put it into your mods folder

**Fabric**: you'll also have two files, one that ends with "-sources.jar" and one without, take the one that doens't end with "-sources.jar", take it and put it into your mods folder, don't forget the Fabric API !\
